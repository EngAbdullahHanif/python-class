The session will cover the following topics:

1. Introduction to Lists and Their Properties:

   - Definition of lists: Lists are ordered collections of items, enclosed in square brackets `[ ]`, where each item is separated by a comma.
   - Properties of lists: Lists are mutable (can be changed after creation), ordered (preserve the order of elements), and allow for duplicate elements.
   - Examples of lists: Participants will explore examples of lists containing different types of elements (e.g., integers, strings, floats) and varying lengths.

2. Accessing and Modifying List Elements:

   - Indexing: Participants will learn how to access individual elements of a list using zero-based indexing. They will understand how to access elements from the beginning and end of the list using positive and negative indices.
   - Slicing: Participants will learn about list slicing, a technique for accessing sublists or portions of a list using the syntax `[start:end:step]`.
   - Modifying lists: Participants will learn how to modify list elements by assigning new values to specific indices or slices.

3. List Methods and Functions:
   - List methods: Participants will explore built-in list methods for common operations such as adding, removing, sorting, and searching elements in a list. Examples include `append()`, `extend()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `sort()`, and `index()`.
   - List functions: Participants will learn about built-in functions for working with lists, such as `len()`, `min()`, `max()`, and `sum()`. These functions provide useful insights and operations on lists without modifying them.
