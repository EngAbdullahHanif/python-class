## Session 8: Stacks and Queues

Understanding Stack and Queue Data Structures

### Stack:

Definition: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.

#### Operations:

Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Remove the top element from the stack.
Peek/Top: Get the top element without removing it.
IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.

### Queue:

Definition: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This means the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.

#### Operations:

Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue.
Dequeue: Remove the front element from the queue.
Front: Get the front element without removing it.
IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.
