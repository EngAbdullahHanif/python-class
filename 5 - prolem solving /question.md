# Question:

You are given a list of numbers representing the daily temperatures for a week. Write a Python program to calculate the average temperature for the week and count how many days had temperatures above the average.

## Steps to Solve:

1. Define a list of temperatures for a week.
2. Calculate the total sum of temperatures in the list.
3. Calculate the average temperature for the week by dividing the total sum by the number of days.
4. Initialize a variable to count the number of days with temperatures above the average.
5. Iterate through each temperature in the list.
6. For each temperature, check if it is above the average temperature calculated in step 3.
7. If the temperature is above the average, increment the count of days above average.
8. After iterating through all temperatures, print the average temperature for the week and the count of days above average.
